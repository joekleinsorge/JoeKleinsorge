### Hi there 👋

I'm Joey, a  ̶D̶e̶v̶O̶p̶s̶ ̶E̶n̶g̶i̶n̶e̶e̶r̶  Problem solver experienced in developing CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code solutions, and operations automation.

### I work a lot with:

  - 🌱 I’m currently learning some more in-depth Kubernetes administration and better Python practices
  - 🤖 Have a not-so-secret goal of automating everything. At work or home you can find me making the machines do all the boring stuff
